# Popular Movies - Stage 2 project

## Project Submission for Udacity's Android Developer Nanodegree course

This project fetches movies information from theMovieDb.org.
So, in order to execute this application, you will need to request an API Key.

More information can be found at: https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started

In order to use the API Key in this project, create the file "gradle.properties" in the root directory of this project and 
create the varialbe API_KEY and assign the API Key provided by theMovieDB on it.

E.g.:
API_KEY="my-custom-api-key"

If you have any concern, doubt or suggestion __[just let me know]__
